cs1213 final project adapting 2048

2048 is a single-player online game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli, 
in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.
It can be regarded as a type of sliding block puzzle, and is very similar to the Threes! app released a month earlier.

This is an adaptation of the game made in java.

Gabriel Cirulliâ€™s original game can be seen here: http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

**bold**Used:**bold**

*	Swing library (to draw the board)

*	Java KeyEvents for keylisteners (up, down, left, right)

*	Custom classes grid and tile (made a normal array, had to cheat to make it function as a two dimensional array), too lazy to fix

*	enum used to store numbers and colors as constants (you want the 1024 tile or the 512 tile to be different colors but same to each other)


If there is time:

*	HashMap of the most commonly used tiles (i.e. 0, 2, 4) to function as a sort of cache (faster)

*	Score?

*	Let the game continue past 2048
